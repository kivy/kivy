=======================================

Website: http://kivy.org/

Kivy is the toolkit derivated from PyMT.


About 1.0 alpha
---------------

This is alpha, so keep in mind that it might not work as intended at all times.
You can post bug reports and feature requests on our Google Project page :

Introduction
------------

Kivy is a python module for developing multi-touch enabled media rich
applications. Currently the aim is to allow for quick and easy interaction
design and rapid prototype development.

Kivy is written in python, based on OpenGL and supports different input methods
like Mouse, Dual Mouse, TUIO, WiiMote, WM_TOUCH, HIDtouch etc.

Kivy is actively being developed by a community and free to use. It operates on
all major platforms (Linux, OSX, Windows).


Installation
------------

Depending on your operating system you can follow one of the following guides
to install Kivy and the dependencies:

 * http://kivy.org/wiki/DevGuide/InstallKivyUbuntu
 * http://kivy.org/wiki/DevGuide/InstallKivyMacOSX
 * http://kivy.org/wiki/DevGuide/InstallKivyWindows

If you chose to install all the dependencies (see below) yourself, you can invoke
the setup script as follows to install kivy systemwide for python:

  python setup.py install


Dependencies
------------

Since we abstract from the libraries that we use, some dependencies are
optional and may be used instead of others. A list of dependencies and what
we use them for is http://kivy.org/wiki/Devel/FeaturesByLibraries

Here is what works best:

  * python (>= 2.6, < 3.0) - http://python.org
  * PyOpenGL >= 3.0.1
  * Pygame
  * PIL
  * GST + PyGST
  * Cython
  * nosetests >= 0.11 (for unittest)
  * coverage >= 0.34 (for coverage)


Dcoumentation, Examples & Tutorials
-----------------------------------

There is an API reference included in doc. Check the doc/README about how
to build the documentation. It's also available online at :

There is some simple example apps in the examples folder that should get
you started for now. Additionally you may want to take a look at our wiki
at :
