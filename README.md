Introduction
------------

Kivy is a Python framework for the development of multi-touch enabled media rich
applications. The aim is to allow for quick and easy interaction design and
rapid prototyping whilst making your code reusable and deployable.

Kivy is written in Python and Cython, based on OpenGL ES 2, supports various
input devices and has an extensive widget library. With the same codebase,
you can target Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and iOS. All our widgets are built
with multitouch support.

Kivy is MIT licensed, actively developed by a great community and is supported
by many projects managed by the Kivy organisation.

Installation, Documentation, Examples

Extensive installation instructions as well as tutorials and general
