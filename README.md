Innovative User Interfaces Made Easy.

Kivy is a [Python](https://www.python.org) framework for the development of
multi-touch enabled media rich applications. The aim is to allow for quick and
easy interaction design and rapid prototyping whilst making your code reusable
and deployable.

Kivy is written in Python and [Cython](http://cython.org/), based on OpenGL ES
2, supports various input devices and has an extensive widget library. With the
same codebase, you can target Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and iOS. All our
widgets are built with multitouch support.

Kivy is MIT licensed, actively developed by a great community and is supported
by many projects managed by the Kivy organisation.
