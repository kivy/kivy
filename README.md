[Kivy](https://www.kivy.org) is an open-source [Python](https://python.org) framework
for developing GUI apps that work cross-platform, including desktop, mobile and
embedded platforms.

The aim is to allow for quick and easy interaction design and rapid prototyping
whilst making your code reusable and deployable: Innovative user interfaces made
easy.

Kivy is written in Python and [Cython](https://cython.org/) and is built on
[OpenGL ES 2.0](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/). It supports various input 
devices and has an extensive (and extensible) widget library. With the
same codebase, you can target Windows, macOS, Linux (including Raspberry Pi OS),
Android, and iOS. All Kivy widgets are built with multitouch support.

Kivy is [MIT licensed](LICENSE), actively developed by a great community and is
supported by many projects managed by the 
[Kivy Organization](https://www.kivy.org/about.html).
