Introduction
------------

Kivy is a Python library for development of multi-touch enabled media rich
applications. The aim is to allow for quick and easy interaction design and
rapid prototyping, while making your code reusable and deployable.

Kivy is written in Python and Cython, based on OpenGL ES 2, supports various
input devices and have an extensive widgets library. With the same codebase,
you can target Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and iOS. All our widgets are built
with multitouch support.

Kivy is MIT licensed, actively developed by a great community, as well as all
the projects managed by the Kivy organisation.
