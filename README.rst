Introduction
------------

Kivy is a Python library for development of multi-touch enabled media rich
applications. The aim is to allow for quick and easy interaction design and
rapid prototyping, while making your code reusable and deployable.

Kivy is written in Python, based on OpenGL and supports different input devices
such as: Mouse, Dual Mouse, TUIO, WiiMote, WM_TOUCH, HIDtouch, Apple's products
and so on.

Kivy is actively being developed by a community and free to use. It operates on
all major platforms (Linux, OSX, Windows, Android).
