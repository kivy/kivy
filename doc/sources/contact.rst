==========

Are you having trouble using the Kivy framework, or any of its related projects? Is
there an error you don't understand? Are you trying to figure out how to use it? We
have volunteers who can help!

Before you start, please read our :ref:`FAQ <faq>`:
It is the fastest way to solve the most common problems.

The `Kivy Discord Server <https://chat.kivy.org>`_ allows you to chat with people in
real-time and share code snippets. There are several channels marked for support (if
you aren't sure which to use, try #support1).

Please **hang around** in Discord for an answer. We are mostly based in Europe, so
take into account any timezone issues. If you leave before a response, we can't get
back to you.

`Kivy's GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/orgs/kivy/discussions>`_ is another
forum where support questions are welcome, and our volunteers are listening. If it
takes more time to consider an answer, you will be notified when you get a response.

You might like to check our issue trackers out on GitHub. There is the main
`Kivy issue tracker <https://github.com/kivy/kivy/issues>`_, and one for each Kivy
subproject. Feel free to check if others have had the same problem as you, but please
don't submit an issue until it is confirmed as very likely to be a bug in Kivy. Ask
us for help at one of the above forums before submitting an issue.

There are also independent communities on
`StackOverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kivy>`_ and
`Reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/kivy/>`_ that accept Kivy-related support requests.
