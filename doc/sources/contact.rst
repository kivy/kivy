Contact Us
==========

You can contact us in several different ways:


Issue Tracker
-------------

If you have found an issue with the code or have a feature request, please see
our `issue tracker <https://github.com/kivy/kivy/issues>`_. If there is no issue
yet that matches your inquiry, feel free to create a new one. Please make sure
you receive the mails that github sends if we comment on the issue in case we
need more information.
For bugs, please provide all the information necessary, like the operating
system you're using, the **full error message** or any other logs, a description
of what you did to trigger the bug and what the actual bug was,
as well as anything else that might be of interest. Obviously, we can only help
if you tell us precisely what the actual problem is.


Mail
----

For users of our framework, there is a mailing list for support inquiries on the
`kivy-users Google Group <https://groups.google.com/group/kivy-users>`_. Use
this list if you have issues with your Kivy-based app.
We also have a mailing list for matters that deal with development of the actual
Kivy framework code on the
`kivy-dev Google Group <https://groups.google.com/group/kivy-dev>`_.


IRC
---

**#Kivy on irc.freenode.net**

IRC is great for real-time communication, but please make sure to **wait** after
you asked your question. If you just join, ask and quit we have **no way** of
knowing who you were and where we're supposed to send our answer. Also, keep
in mind we're mostly based in Europe, so take into account any timezone issues.
If you're unlucky more than once, try the mailing list.

If you don't have an IRC client, you can also use
`Freenode's web chat <http://webchat.freenode.net/>`_, but please, don't close
the browser window too soon. Just enter ``#kivy`` in the channels field.
