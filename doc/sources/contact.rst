Contact Us
==========

You can contact us in several different ways:


Issue Tracker
-------------

If you have found an issue with the code or have a feature request, please see
our `issue tracker <https://github.com/kivy/kivy/issues>`_. If there is no issue
yet that matches your inquiry, feel free to create a new one. Please make sure
you receive the mails that github sends if we comment on the issue in case we
need more information.
For bugs, please provide all the information necessary, like the operating
system you're using, the **full error message** or any other logs, a description
of what you did to trigger the bug and what the actual bug was,
as well as anything else that might be of interest. Obviously, we can only help
if you tell us precisely what the actual problem is.


Mail
----

For users of our framework, there is a mailing list for support inquiries on the
`kivy-users Google Group <https://groups.google.com/group/kivy-users>`_. Use
this list if you have issues with your Kivy-based app.
We also have a mailing list for matters that deal with development of the actual
Kivy framework code on the
`kivy-dev Google Group <https://groups.google.com/group/kivy-dev>`_.


IRC
---

**#Kivy on irc.freenode.net**

IRC is great for real-time communication, but please make sure to **wait** after
you asked your question. If you just join, ask and quit we have **no way** of
knowing who you were and where we're supposed to send our answer. Also, keep
in mind we're mostly based in Europe, so take into account any timezone issues.
If you're unlucky more than once, try the mailing list.

If you don't have an IRC client, you can also use
`Freenode's web chat <http://webchat.freenode.net/>`_, but please, don't close
the browser window too soon. Just enter ``#kivy`` in the channels field.


**Some #kivy guidelines**

* Be polite and respectful towards other users.
* Please use English for all messages and in any code posted.
* Do not post large log/code copy and pastes to the channel, instead use a site
  such as http://pastebin.com/ or https://gist.github.com/ .
* If you have a question, be clear and succinct to ensure the fastest response.
  Don't just say "it doesn't work" or “help”. Instead, describe what you
  expected to happen and what actually happened. Show code, pictures, or error
  logs as necessary.
* If your code follows `PEP8 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
  you will most likely receive a quicker answer.
* Try to lower the barrier to helping you as much as possible, if we need to
  run your application, share it in one file like in
  `this template <https://gist.github.com/Kovak/f5e1539c938c3595a54e>`_. Do not
  share your entire application, share a simple example that showcases only the
  issue you are experiencing.
* **Avoid topics that may make others uncomfortable or that are excessively
  incendiary.** #kivy is a community for learning and troubleshooting. There
  are other places for discussions on sex, drugs, politics, religion, and
  anything else you can think of to talk about that could potentially be
  uncomfortable or inflammatory in nature for others.
* **Also Avoid**:
    * Racial epithets of any kind regardless of context.
    * Excessive Swearing.
    * Misogynist, misandrist, homophobic or transphobic behavior or attitudes.
