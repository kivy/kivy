Unit tests
==========

Tests are located in the `kivy/tests` folder. If you find a bug in Kivy, a good
thing to do can be to write a minimal case showing the issue and to ask core
devs if the behaviour shown is intended or a real bug. If you write your code
as a `unittest <http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html>`_
, it will prevent the bug from coming back unnoticed in the future, and wil
make Kivy a better, stronger project. Writing a unittest may be a really good
way to get familiar with Kivy while doing something useful.

Unit tests are separated into two cases:

* Non graphical unit tests: these are standard unit tests that can run in a
  console
* Graphical unit tests: these need a GL context, and if requested, work via
  image comparison

To be able to run unit tests, you need to install nose
(http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/), and coverage
(http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/). You can use easy_install for that::

    sudo easy_install nose coverage

Then, in the kivy directory::

    make test

How it works
------------

All the tests are located in `kivy/tests`, and the filename starts with
`test_<name>.py`. Nose will automatically gather all the files and classes
inside this folder, and use them to generate test cases.

To write a test, create a file that respects the previous naming, then
start with this template::

    import unittest

    class XXXTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

        def setUp(self):
            # import class and prepare everything here.
            pass

        def test_YYY(self):
            # place your test case here
            a = 1
            self.assertEqual(a, 1)

Replace `XXX` with an appropriate name that covers your tests cases, then
replace 'YYY' with the name of your test. If you have any doubts, check how
the other tests have been written.

Then, to execute them, just run::

    make test

If you want to execute that file only, you can run::

    nosetests kivy/tests/test_yourtestcase.py

or include this simple `unittest.main()` call at the end of the file and run
the test with `python test_yourtestcase.py`::

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()


Graphical unit tests
--------------------

While simple unit tests are fine and useful to keep things granular, in certain
cases we need to test Kivy after the GL Window is created to interact with the
graphics, widgets and to test more advanced stuff such as widget, modules,
various cases of input and interaction with everything that becomes available
only after the Window is created and Kivy properly initialized.

These tests are executed the same way like the ordinary unit tests i.e. either
with `nosetests` or via `unittest.main()`.

Here are two similar examples with different approaches of running the app.
In the first one you are setting up the required stuff manually and the
`tearDown()` of the `GraphicUnitTest` may only attempt to clean it after you::

    from kivy.tests.common import GraphicUnitTest

    class MyTestCase(GraphicUnitTest):

        def test_runtouchapp(self):
            # non-integrated approach
            from kivy.app import runTouchApp
            from kivy.uix.button import Button

            button = Button()
            runTouchApp(button)

            # get your Window instance safely
            from kivy.base import EventLoop
            EventLoop.ensure_window()
            window = EventLoop.window

            # your asserts
            self.assertEqual(window.children[0], button)
            self.assertEqual(
                window.children[0].height,
                window.height
            )

In the second test case both `setUp()` and `tearDown()` work together with
`GraphicUnitTest.render()`. This is the basic setup it does automatically:

* Window is sized to 320 x 240 px
* Only the default Config is used during the test, it's restricted with the
  `KIVY_USE_DEFAULTCONFIG` environment variable
* Any input (mouse/touch/...) is *removed* and if you need to test it, either
  mock it or manually add it
* Window's canvas is cleared before displaying any widget tree

.. warning::
   Do NOT use absolute numbers in your tests to preserve the functionality
   across the all resolutions. Instead, use e.g. relative position or size and
   multiply it by the `Window.size` in your test.

::

    from kivy.tests.common import GraphicUnitTest, UnitTestTouch

    class MyTestCase(GraphicUnitTest):

        def test_render(self):
            from kivy.uix.button import Button

            # with GraphicUnitTest.render() you basically do this:
            # runTouchApp(Button()) + some setup before
            button = Button()
            self.render(button)

            # get your Window instance safely
            from kivy.base import EventLoop
            EventLoop.ensure_window()
            window = EventLoop.window

            touch = UnitTestTouch(
                *[s / 2.0 for s in window.size]
            )

            # bind something to test the touch with
            button.bind(
                on_release=lambda instance: setattr(
                    instance, 'test_released', True
                )
            )

            # then let's touch the Window's center
            touch.touch_down()
            touch.touch_up()
            self.assertTrue(button.test_released)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        import unittest
        unittest.main()

.. note::
   Make sure you check the source of `kivy.tests.common` before writing
   comprehensive test cases.


GL unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GL unit test are more difficult. You must know that even if OpenGL is a
standard, the output/rendering is not. It depends on your GPU and the driver
used. For these tests, the goal is to save the output of the rendering at
frame X, and compare it to a reference image.

Currently, images are generated at 320x240 pixels, in *png* format.

.. note::

    Currently, image comparison is done per-pixel. This means the reference
    image that you generate will only be correct for your GPU/driver. If
    somebody can implement image comparison with "delta" support, patches
    are welcome :)

To execute GL unit tests, you need to create a directory::

    mkdir kivy/tests/results
    KIVY_UNITTEST_SCREENSHOTS=1 make test

The results directory will contain all the reference images and the
generated images. After the first execution, if the results directory is empty,
no comparison will be done. It will use the generated images as reference.
After the second execution, all the images will be compared to the reference
images.

A html file is available to show the comparison before/after the test, and a
snippet of the associated unit test. It will be generated at:

    kivy/tests/build/index.html

.. note::

    The build directory is cleaned after each call to `make test`. If you don't
    want that, just use nosetests command.

Writing GL Unit tests
---------------------

The idea is to create a root widget, as you would do in
:meth:`~kivy.app.App.build`, or in :func:`kivy.base.runTouchApp`.
You'll give that root widget to a rendering function which will capture the
output in X frames.

Here is an example::

    from kivy.tests.common import GraphicUnitTest

    class VertexInstructionTestCase(GraphicUnitTest):

        def test_ellipse(self):
            from kivy.uix.widget import Widget
            from kivy.graphics import Ellipse, Color
            r = self.render

            # create a root widget
            wid = Widget()

            # put some graphics instruction on it
            with wid.canvas:
                Color(1, 1, 1)
                self.e = Ellipse(pos=(100, 100), size=(200, 100))

            # render, and capture it directly
            r(wid)

            # as alternative, you can capture in 2 frames:
            r(wid, 2)

            # or in 10 frames
            r(wid, 10)

Each call to `self.render` (or `r` in our example) will generate an image named
as follows::

    <classname>_<funcname>-<r-call-count>.png

`r-call-count` represents the number of times that `self.render` is called
inside the test function.

The reference images are named::

    ref_<classname>_<funcname>-<r-call-count>.png

You can easily replace the reference image with a new one if you wish.


Coverage reports
----------------

Coverage is based on the execution of previous tests. Statistics on code
coverage are automatically calculated during execution. You can generate an html
report of the coverage with the command::

    make cover

Then, open `kivy/htmlcov/index.html` with your favorite web browser.
