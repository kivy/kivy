even add your own snippet in the user snippets section.

Follow the :doc:`/guide-index` to get even more familiar with kivy.

See how to use different :mod:`Modules <kivy.modules>` in the modules section,
such as the :mod:`Inspector <kivy.modules.inspector>` for live inspection.

Learn how to handle custom :mod:`Input <kivy.input>`.

See how kivy has been extended with :mod:`extensions <kivy.ext>` support.

Familiarize yourself with the :mod:`kivy framework <kivy>`.
