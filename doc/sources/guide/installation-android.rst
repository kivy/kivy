Installation on Android
=======================

.. note::

    The android version is not fully supported yet. Check :doc:`android` for
    more information about the current status.

You remind you that Kivy is a framework. Installing Kivy itself on your phone will do
absolutly nothing. Kivy is not an application.

BUT, despite this agreement, we are releasing a "launcher", that permit you to push
your kivy application onto your phone, and execute them through a simple interface.
We'll provide instruction for packaging your kivy application in the future.

To install Kivy launcher, you can:

#. Go on the `Kivy Launcher <https://market.android.com/details?id=org.kivy.pygame>`_
   on the Android market
#. Click on Install
#. Select your phone.. and you're done !

Now, you can push your Kivy's applications in the kivy directory on the sdcard. Check the
:doc:`android` for learning specials tricks for android platform.

Installation of examples
------------------------

.. warning::

    Theses examples are not final, just tests for Kivy environment.

#. Download the `KivyTest for Android <http://kivy.googlecode.com/files/kivytest-for-android.zip>`_
#. Unzip the content into your sdcard of your phone, in the kivy directory::

    /sdcard/kivy

#. Run the launcher and select Kivytest
