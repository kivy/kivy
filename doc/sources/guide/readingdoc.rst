How to read the documentation
=============================

The documentation is seperated into 2 parts:

    - the Programming Guide: it's a must read to understand the Kivy
      basics, especially if you have never done GUI programming before.
    - the API: all the functions, classes, methods are explained.


Importing a class
-----------------

The API section is autogenerated from the source code. Taking any class,
the documentation will look something like this:

.. image:: images/api-button.jpg

It should be read as follows: the "Button" class is in the "kivy.uix.button"
module. If you want to import the class in your code, you will write::

    from kivy.uix.button import Button
