Welcome to Kivy
===============

Welcome to Kivy's documentation. Kivy is an open source software library for rapid
development of applications equipped with novel user interfaces, such as
multi-touch apps.

You are probably wondering why you'd be interested in using Kivy. There is
a document outlining our :ref:`philosophy` that we encourage you to read.

We recommend that you get started with :ref:`installation` and then head over to
the :ref:`quickstart` document. Besides the quickstart, there is also a more
detailed :ref:`architecture`.

If you want to contribute to Kivy, make sure to read :ref:`contributing`. If your
concern isn't addressed in the documentation, feel free to :ref:`contact`.

Appendix
========

The appendix contains licensing information and an enumeration of all the
different module, class, function and variable names available in Kivy.

In a nutshell the license allows you to use Kivy in your own projects,
regardless if they are open source, closed source, commercial or free.
