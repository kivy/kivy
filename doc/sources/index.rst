Welcome to Kivy
===============

Welcome to Kivy's documentation. Kivy is an open source software library for the
rapid development of applications equipped with novel user interfaces, such as
multi-touch apps.

We recommend that you get started with :doc:`/gettingstarted/index`. Then head
over to the :ref:`guide-index`. We also have :ref:`quickstart` if you are
impatient.

You are probably wondering why you should be interested in using Kivy. There is
a document outlining our :ref:`philosophy` that we encourage you to read, and a
detailed :ref:`architecture`.

If you want to contribute to Kivy, make sure to read :ref:`contributing`. If
your concern isn't addressed in the documentation, feel free to :ref:`contact`.

Appendix

The appendix contains licensing information and an enumeration of all the
different modules, classes, functions and variables available in Kivy.
