Installation on Android
=======================

Please note that Kivy is a framework. Installing Kivy itself on your phone will do
absolutely nothing. Kivy is not an application.

That said, we provide a "launcher" that allows you to push
your Kivy application onto your phone and execute it through a simple interface.
We'll provide instructions for packaging your Kivy application in a standalone
way in the future.

To install the Kivy launcher, you must:

#. Go to the `Kivy Launcher <https://market.android.com/details?id=org.kivy.pygame>`_
   on the Google Play Store
#. Click on Install
#. Select your phone... And you're done!

If you don't have Google Play Store on your tablet, check http://kivy.org/#download for downloading the APK manually.

Now, you can put your Kivy applications in the Kivy directory on the SD Card.
Refer to :ref:`android` for a more detailed explanation.
