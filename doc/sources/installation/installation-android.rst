Installation on Android
=======================

Please note that Kivy is a framework. Installing Kivy itself on your phone will do
absolutely nothing. Kivy is not an application.

That said, we provide a "launcher" that allows you to push
your Kivy application onto your phone and execute it through a simple interface.
Instructions for packaging your Kivy app as a standalone application
can be found in the programming guide under
:doc:`Create a package for Android </guide/packaging-android>`.

To install the Kivy launcher, you must:

#. Go to the `Kivy Launcher <https://market.android.com/details?id=org.kivy.pygame>`_
   on the Google Play Store
#. Click on Install
#. Select your phone... And you're done!

If you don't have access to the Google Play Store on your phone/tablet,
you can download and install the APK manually from  http://kivy.org/#download.

Once the Kivy laucher is installed, you can put your Kivy applications in the Kivy
directory on the SD Card. The launcher will then automatically detect and display
them in its menu, provided you have
:ref:`packaged them correctly <Packaging your application for Kivy Launcher>`.

Refer to :ref:`android` for a more detailed explanation.
