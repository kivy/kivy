'''
Suite of Application Builders
=============================

This explores different methods of starting an application. If you run
this without a command line parameter, you should see a menu in your terminal.
You can also run this with a 'r' parameter to pick a random method.
There are lots of logging options to make this easier to debug: the execution
order may not be obvious. Each time you run the command, only one kivy
application is created.

This uses the file testkvfile.kv and the file app_suite_data/testkvdir.kv.

Try using one of these:
   b - Use build() method to return a widget
   d - Use a kv file from a different directory
   f - Use a kv file with the widget object
   p - Use prebuilt widget inside a layout
   s - Use a kivy language string to create the widget
