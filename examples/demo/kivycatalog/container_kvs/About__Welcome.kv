    text: "Welcome\n---------------\nThis Kivy Catalog is an interactive showcase of Kivy Widgets defined with the Kivy (.kv) language. You can edit the .kv language description in the left pane and see your changes affect the widgets in the right pane.   Your changes will update the widget within a few seconds though the impatient could type 'Ctrl-S' or click 'Render Now'.\n\nYou can explore most Kivy widgets from the menu in the upper left corner.  You can also use this playground to test your Kivy language code and adding a new .kv file to the interface is easy.\n\nSome Kivy widgets are omitted from this catalog or could have more complete .kv representation.  This is beta software; pull requests are welcome."
