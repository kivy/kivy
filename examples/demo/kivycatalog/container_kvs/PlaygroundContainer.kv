    text: "Welcome\n---------------\nThe Kivy Catalog is an interactive showcase of Kivy Widgets defined in the Kivy language. For each widget you see, you can directly edit the .kv language syntax to see what effects your changes have on the widget. Click 'Render' or hit 'Ctrl-S' to view your changes.\n\nThere is also a playground on this tab where you can test your Kivy language code directly. This is beta software. The basics seem to work, but some widgets are missing or don't have the ideal .kv representation. Not all widgets are represented yet. It is trivial to add a new .kv file to the interface.\n\nPull requests are welcome."
