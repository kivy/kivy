FBO example
===========

This is an example of how to use FBO (Frame Buffer Object) to speedup graphics.
An Fbo is like a texture that you can draw on it.

By default, all the children are added in the canvas of the parent.
When you are displaying thousand of widget, you'll do thousands of graphics
instructions each frame.
The idea is to do this drawing only one time in a Fbo, and then, draw the Fbo
every frame instead of all children's graphics instructions.

We created a FboFloatLayout that create his canvas, and a Fbo.
After the Fbo is created, we are adding Color and Rectangle instruction to
display the texture of the Fbo itself.
The overload of on_pos/on_size are here to update size of Fbo if needed, and
adapt the position/size of the rectangle too.

Then, when a child is added or removed, we are redirecting addition/removal of
graphics instruction to our Fbo. This is why add_widget/remove_widget are
overloaded too.

.. note::

    This solution can be helpful but not ideal. Multisampling are not available
    in Framebuffer. We will work to add the support of it if the hardware is
    capable of, but it could be not the same.
