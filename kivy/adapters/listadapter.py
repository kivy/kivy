ListAdapter
=================

.. versionadded:: 1.5

.. warning::

    This code is still experimental, and its API is subject to change in a
    future version.

A :class:`ListAdapter` is an adapter around a python list.

From :class:`~kivy.adapters.adapter.Adapter`, a
:class:`~kivy.adapters.listadapter.ListAdapter` gets cls, template, and
args_converter properties.

From :class:`~kivy.selection.Selection` are properties that control
selection behaviour:

* *selection*, a list of selected items.

* *selection_mode*, 'single', 'multiple', 'none'

* *allow_empty_selection*, a boolean -- If False, a selection is forced. If
  True, and only user or programmatic action will change selection, it can
  be empty.

    :Events:

        `on_data_change`: (view, view list )
            Fired when data changes

.. versionchanged:: 1.6.0

    Added data = ListProperty([]), which was proably inadvertently deleted at
    some point. This means that whenever data changes an update will fire,
    instead of having to reset the data object (Adapter has data defined as
    an ObjectProperty, so we need to reset it here to ListProperty). See also
    DictAdapter and its set of data = DictProperty().

.. versionchanged:: 1.8.0

    A new class, OpObservableList is passed to ListProperty to replace its
    internal use of ObservableList. OpObservableList dispatches change events
    on a per op basis, as compared to the gross dispatching done by
    ObservableList. This new functionality is paired with changeds in ListView,
    which now reacts in a more fine-grained way to data changes. See its new
    data_changed() method. See also new adapter modules, list_ops.py and
    dict_ops.py which contain code for the more detailed dispatching logic.

class ListAdapter(Selection, Adapter):
    '''A :class:`~kivy.adapters.listadapter.ListAdapter` is an adapter around a
    python list of items. It is an alternative to the dict capabilities of
    :class:`~kivy.adapters.dictadapter.DictAdapter`.

    :class:`~kivy.adapters.dictadapter.ListAdapter` and
    :class:`~kivy.adapters.listadapter.DictAdapter` use special
    :class:`~kivy.properties.ListProperty` and
    :class:`~kivy.properties.DictProperty` variants,
    :class:`~kivy.properties.OpObservableList` and
    :class:`~kivy.properties.OpObservableDict`, which record
    op_info for use in the adapter system.

    The data property of :class:`~kivy.adapters.listadapter.ListAdapter` is a
    :class:`~kivy.properties.OpObservableList`.

    This system endeavors to allow normal Python programming of the contained
    data list object. When normal operations such as append, insert, pop,
    sort, are performed on the data list, and the system will notice those
    changes and react accordingly, adjusting its cached_views and selection in
    support of the "collection" style view that uses the adapter (e.g.,
    :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListView`).

    This adapter supports collection-style widgets such as
    :class:`~kivy.uix.widgets.ListView`. When something happens in an
    application to change the data list, the name of the data operation that
    occurred, along with start_index, end_index of the item(s) affected are
    stored.  The adapter, via its instance of a
    :class:`~kivy.properties.ListOpHandler`, has callbacks that handle specific
    operations, and make needed changes to the internal cached_views,
    selection, and related properties, in preparation for sending, in turn, a
    data-changed event to the collection-style widget that uses the adapter.
    For example, :class:`~kivy.uix.widgets.ListView` observes its adapter for
    data-changed events and updates the user interface. When an item is
    deleted, it removes the item view widget from its container, or for an
    addition, it adds the item view widget to its container and scrolls the
    list, and so on.

    .. versionadded:: 1.5

    .. versionchanged:: 1.8.0

        A new class, OpObserverableList, was added to kivy/properties.pyx as an
        alternative to ObservableList, which only dispatches when data is
        set, or when any change occurs. The new ObObservableList dispatches on
        a fine-grained basis, after any individual op is performed.

        This new class is used in the ListProperty for data.

        ListAdapter must react to the events that come for a change to data.
        It delegates handling of these events to a ListOpHandler
        instance, defined in a new module, adapters/list_ops.py. This handling
        mainly involves adjusting cached_views and selection, in support of
        collection type widgets, such as ListView, that use ListAdapter.

        The data_changed() method of the delegate ListOpHandler and methods
        called there do what is needed to cached_views and selection, then they
        dispatch, in turn, up to the owning collection type view, such as
        ListView. The collection type view then reacts with changes to its
        children and other parts of the user interface as needed.
