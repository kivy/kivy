ListAdapter
=================

.. versionadded:: 1.5

.. warning::

    This code is still experimental, and its API is subject to change in a
    future version.

A :class:`ListAdapter` is an adapter around a python list.

Selection operations are a main concern for the class.

From an :class:`Adapter`, a :class:`ListAdapter` gets cls, template, and
args_converter properties and adds others that control selection behaviour:

* *selection*, a list of selected items.

* *selection_mode*, 'single', 'multiple', 'none'

* *allow_empty_selection*, a boolean -- If False, a selection is forced. If
  True, and only user or programmatic action will change selection, it can
  be empty.

If you wish to have a bare-bones list adapter, without selection, use a
:class:`~kivy.adapters.simplelistadapter.SimpleListAdapter`.

A :class:`~kivy.adapters.dictadapter.DictAdapter` is a subclass of a
:class:`~kivy.adapters.listadapter.ListAdapter`. They both dispatch the
*on_selection_change* event.

    :Events:
        `on_selection_change`: (view, view list )
            Fired when selection changes

.. versionchanged:: 1.6.0

    Added data = ListProperty([]), which was proably inadvertently deleted at
    some point. This means that whenever data changes an update will fire,
    instead of having to reset the data object (Adapter has data defined as
    an ObjectProperty, so we need to reset it here to ListProperty). See also
    DictAdapter and its set of data = DictProperty().

         permanently, for an existing list adapter.
         A :class:`~kivy.adapters.listadapter.ListAdapter` is not meant to be
         used as a primary no-selection list adapter.  Use a
         :class:`~kivy.adapters.simplelistadapter.SimpleListAdapter` for that.

       * *single*, multi-touch/click ignored. Single item selection only.

    propagate_selection_to_data = BooleanProperty(False)
    '''Normally, data items are not selected/deselected because the data items
    might not have an is_selected boolean property -- only the item view for a
    given data item is selected/deselected as part of the maintained selection
    list. However, if the data items do have an is_selected property, or if
    they mix in :class:`~kivy.adapters.models.SelectableDataItem`, the
    selection machinery can propagate selection to data items. This can be
    useful for storing selection state in a local database or backend database
    for maintaining state in game play or other similar scenarios. It is a
    convenience function.

    To propagate selection or not?

    Consider a shopping list application for shopping for fruits at the
    market. The app allows for the selection of fruits to buy for each day of
    the week, presenting seven lists: one for each day of the week. Each list is
    loaded with all the available fruits, but the selection for each is a
    subset. There is only one set of fruit data shared between the lists, so
    it would not make sense to propagate selection to the data because
    selection in any of the seven lists would clash and mix with that of the
    others.

    However, consider a game that uses the same fruits data for selecting
    fruits available for fruit-tossing. A given round of play could have a
    full fruits list, with fruits available for tossing shown selected. If the
    game is saved and rerun, the full fruits list, with selection marked on
    each item, would be reloaded correctly if selection is always propagated to
    the data. You could accomplish the same functionality by writing code to
    operate on list selection, but having selection stored in the data
    ListProperty might prove convenient in some cases.

    :data:`propagate_selection_to_data` is a
    :class:`~kivy.properties.BooleanProperty` and defaults to False.
    '''

    allow_empty_selection = BooleanProperty(True)
    '''The allow_empty_selection may be used for cascading selection between
    several list views, or between a list view and an observing view. Such
    automatic maintenance of the selection is important for all but simple
    list displays. Set allow_empty_selection to False and the selection is
    auto-initialized and always maintained, so any observing views
    may likewise be updated to stay in sync.

    :data:`allow_empty_selection` is a
    :class:`~kivy.properties.BooleanProperty` and defaults to True.
    '''

    selection_limit = NumericProperty(-1)
    '''When the selection_mode is multiple and the selection_limit is
    non-negative, this number will limit the number of selected items. It can
    be set to 1, which is equivalent to single selection. If selection_limit is
    not set, the default value is -1, meaning that no limit will be enforced.

    :data:`selection_limit` is a :class:`~kivy.properties.NumericProperty` and
    defaults to -1 (no limit).
    '''

    cached_views = DictProperty({})
