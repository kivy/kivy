'''
Application
===========

The :class:`App` class is the base for creating Kivy applications.
Think of it as your main entry point into the Kivy run loop.  In most cases, you
subclass this class and make your own app. You create an instance of your
specific app class and then, when you are ready to start the application's life
cycle, you call your instance's :func:`App.run` method.


Creating an Application
-----------------------

Method using build() override
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To initialize your app with a widget tree, override the build() method in
your app class and return the widget tree you constructed.

Here's an example of a very simple application that just shows a button:

.. include:: ../../examples/application/app_with_build.py
   :literal:

The file is also available in the examples folder at
:file:`kivy/examples/application/app_with_build.py`.

Here, no widget tree was constructed (or if you will, a tree with only the root
node).


Method using kv file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also use the :doc:`api-kivy.lang` for creating applications. The .kv can
contain rules and root widget definitions at the same time. Here is the same
example as the Button one in a kv file.

Contents of 'test.kv':

.. include:: ../../examples/application/test.kv
   :literal:

Contents of 'main.py':

.. include:: ../../examples/application/app_with_kv.py
   :literal:

See :file:`kivy/examples/application/app_with_kv.py`.

The relation between main.py and test.kv is explained in :func:`App.load_kv`.


Application configuration
-------------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.0.7

Use the configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your application might want to have its own configuration file. The
:class:`App` is able to handle an INI file automatically. You add your
section/key/value in the :meth:`App.build_config` method by using the `config`
parameters (instance of :class:`~kivy.config.ConfigParser`::

    class TestApp(App):
        def build_config(self, config):
            config.setdefaults('section1', {
                'key1': 'value1',
                'key2': '42'
            })

As soon as you add one section in the config, a file is created on the disk, and
named from the mangled name of your class:. "TestApp" will give a config
file-name "test.ini" with the content::

    [section1]
    key1 = value1
    key2 = 42

The "test.ini" will be automatically loaded at runtime, and you can access the
configuration in your :meth:`App.build` method::

    class TestApp(App):
        def build_config(self, config):
            config.setdefaults('section1', {
                'key1': 'value1',
                'key2': '42'
            })

        def build(self):
            config = self.config
            return Label(text='key1 is %s and key2 is %d' % (
                config.get('section1', 'key1'),
                config.getint('section1', 'key2')))

Create a settings panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your application can have a settings panel to let your user configure some of
your config tokens. Here is an example done in the KinectViewer example
(available in the examples directory):

    .. image:: images/app-settings.jpg
        :align: center

You can extend the default application settings with your own panel by extending
the :meth:`App.build_settings` method.
Check the class:`~kivy.uix.settings.Settings` about how to create a panel,
because you need a JSON file / data first.

Let's take as an example the previous snippet of TestApp with custom config. We
could create a JSON like this::

    [
        { "type": "title",
          "title": "Test application" },

        { "type": "options",
          "title": "My first key",
          "desc": "Description of my first key",
          "section": "section1",
          "key": "key1",
          "options": ["value1", "value2", "another value"] },

        { "type": "numeric",
          "title": "My second key",
          "desc": "Description of my second key",
          "section": "section1",
          "key": "key2" }
    ]

Then, we can create a panel using this JSON to create automatically all the
options, and link them to our :data:`App.config` ConfigParser instance::

    class TestApp(App):
        # ...
        def build_settings(self, settings):
            jsondata = """... put the json data here ..."""
            settings.add_json_panel('Test application',
                self.config, data=jsondata)

That's all ! Now you can press F1 (default keystroke) to toggle the settings
panel, or press the "settings" key on your android device. You can manually call
:meth:`App.open_settings` and :meth:`App.close_settings` if you want. Every
change in the panel is automatically saved in the config file.

However, you might want to know when a config value has been changed by the
user, in order to adapt or reload your UI. You can overload the
:meth:`on_config_change` method::

    class TestApp(self):
        # ...
        def on_config_change(self, config, section, key, value):
            if config is self.config:
                token = (section, key)
                if token == ('section1', 'key1'):
                    print 'Our key1 have been changed to', value
                elif token == ('section1', 'key2'):
                    print 'Our key2 have been changed to', value

One last note, the Kivy configuration panel is added by default in the settings
instance. If you don't want it, you can declare your Application like this::

    class TestApp(App):
        use_kivy_settings = False
        # ...


Pause mode
----------

.. versionadded:: 1.1.0

.. warning::

    This mode is experimental, and designed for phones/tablets. There are some
    cases where your application could crash on resume.

On tablets and phones, the user can switch at any moment to another application.
By default, your application will reach :func:`App.on_stop` behavior.

You can support the Pause mode: when switching to another application, the
application goes into Pause mode and waits infinitely until the user
switches back to your application. There is an issue with OpenGL on Android
devices: you're not ensured that the OpenGL ES Context is restored when your app
resumes. The mechanism for restoring all the OpenGL data is not yet implemented
into Kivy(we are looking for device with this behavior).

The current implemented Pause mechanism is:

    #. Kivy checks every frame, if Pause mode is activated by the Operating
       System, due to user switching to another application, phone shutdown or
       any other reason.
    #. :func:`App.on_pause` is called:
    #. If False is returned (default case), then :func:`App.on_stop` is called.
    #. Otherwise the application will sleep until the OS will resume our App
    #. We got a `resume`, :func:`App.on_resume` is called.
    #. If our app memory has been reclaimed by the OS, then nothing will be
       called.

.. warning::

    Both `on_pause` and `on_stop` must save important data, because after
    `on_pause` call, on_resume may not be called at all.
