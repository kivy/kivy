'''
Application
===========

The :class:`App` class is the base for creating Kivy applications.
Think of it as your main entry point into the Kivy run loop. In most
cases, you subclass this class and make your own app. You create an
instance of your specific app class and then, when you are ready to
start the application's life cycle, you call your instance's
:meth:`App.run` method.


Creating an Application
-----------------------

Method using build() override
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To initialize your app with a widget tree, override the :meth:`~App.build`
method in your app class and return the widget tree you constructed.

Here's an example of a very simple application that just shows a button:

.. include:: ../../examples/application/app_with_build.py
   :literal:

The file is also available in the examples folder at
:file:`kivy/examples/application/app_with_build.py`.

Here, no widget tree was constructed (or if you will, a tree with only
the root node).


Method using kv file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also use the :doc:`api-kivy.lang` for creating applications. The
.kv can contain rules and root widget definitions at the same time. Here
is the same example as the Button one in a kv file.

Contents of 'test.kv':

.. include:: ../../examples/application/test.kv
   :literal:

Contents of 'main.py':

.. include:: ../../examples/application/app_with_kv.py
   :literal:

See :file:`kivy/examples/application/app_with_kv.py`.

The relationship between main.py and test.kv is explained in
:meth:`App.load_kv`.

.. _Application configuration:

Application configuration
-------------------------

Use the configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your application might need its own configuration file. The
:class:`App` class handles 'ini' files automatically if you add
the section key-value pair to the :meth:`App.build_config` method using the
`config` parameter (an instance of :class:`~kivy.config.ConfigParser`)::

    class TestApp(App):
        def build_config(self, config):
            config.setdefaults('section1', {
                'key1': 'value1',
                'key2': '42'
            })

As soon as you add one section to the config, a file is created on the
disk (see :attr:`~App.get_application_config` for its location) and
named based your class name. "TestApp" will give a config file named
"test.ini" with the content::

    [section1]
    key1 = value1
    key2 = 42

The "test.ini" will be automatically loaded at runtime and you can access the
configuration in your :meth:`App.build` method::

    class TestApp(App):
        def build_config(self, config):
            config.setdefaults('section1', {
                'key1': 'value1',
                'key2': '42'
            })

        def build(self):
            config = self.config
            return Label(text='key1 is %s and key2 is %d' % (
                config.get('section1', 'key1'),
                config.getint('section1', 'key2')))

Create a settings panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your application can have a settings panel to let your user configure some of
your config tokens. Here is an example done in the KinectViewer example
(available in the examples directory):

    .. image:: images/app-settings.jpg
        :align: center

You can add your own panels of settings by extending
the :meth:`App.build_settings` method.
Check the :class:`~kivy.uix.settings.Settings` about how to create a panel,
because you need a JSON file / data first.

Let's take as an example the previous snippet of TestApp with custom
config. We could create a JSON like this::

    [
        { "type": "title",
          "title": "Test application" },

        { "type": "options",
          "title": "My first key",
          "desc": "Description of my first key",
          "section": "section1",
          "key": "key1",
          "options": ["value1", "value2", "another value"] },

        { "type": "numeric",
          "title": "My second key",
          "desc": "Description of my second key",
          "section": "section1",
          "key": "key2" }
    ]

Then, we can create a panel using this JSON to automatically create all the
options and link them to our :attr:`App.config` ConfigParser instance::

    class TestApp(App):
        # ...
        def build_settings(self, settings):
            jsondata = """... put the json data here ..."""
            settings.add_json_panel('Test application',
                self.config, data=jsondata)

That's all! Now you can press F1 (default keystroke) to toggle the
settings panel or press the "settings" key on your android device. You
can manually call :meth:`App.open_settings` and
:meth:`App.close_settings` if you want to handle this manually. Every
change in the panel is automatically saved in the config file.

You can also use :meth:`App.build_settings` to modify properties of
the settings panel. For instance, the default panel has a sidebar for
switching between json panels whose width defaults to 200dp. If you'd
prefer this to be narrower, you could add::

    settings.interface.menu.width = dp(100)

to your :meth:`build_settings` method.

You might want to know when a config value has been changed by the
user in order to adapt or reload your UI. You can then overload the
:meth:`on_config_change` method::

    class TestApp(App):
        # ...
        def on_config_change(self, config, section, key, value):
            if config is self.config:
                token = (section, key)
                if token == ('section1', 'key1'):
                    print('Our key1 has been changed to', value)
                elif token == ('section1', 'key2'):
                    print('Our key2 has been changed to', value)

The Kivy configuration panel is added by default to the settings
instance. If you don't want this panel, you can declare your Application as
follows::

    class TestApp(App):
        use_kivy_settings = False
        # ...

This only removes the Kivy panel but does not stop the settings instance
from appearing. If you want to prevent the settings instance from appearing
altogether, you can do this::

    class TestApp(App):
        def open_settings(self, *largs):
            pass

.. versionadded:: 1.0.7

Profiling with on_start and on_stop
-----------------------------------

It is often useful to profile python code in order to discover locations to
optimise. The standard library profilers
(http://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html) provides multiple options for
profiling code. For profiling the entire program, the natural
approaches of using profile as a module or profile's run method does not work
with Kivy. It is however, possible to use :meth:`App.on_start` and
:meth:`App.on_stop` methods::

    import cProfile

    class MyApp(App):
        def on_start(self):
            self.profile = cProfile.Profile()
            self.profile.enable()

        def on_stop(self):
            self.profile.disable()
            self.profile.dump_stats('myapp.profile')

This will create a file called `myapp.profile` when you exit your app.

Customising layout
------------------

You can choose different settings widget layouts by setting
:attr:`App.settings_cls`. By default, this is a
:class:`~kivy.uix.settings.Settings` class which provides the pictured
sidebar layout, but you could set it to any of the other layouts
provided in :mod:`kivy.uix.settings` or create your own. See the
module documentation for :mod:`kivy.uix.settings` for more
information.

You can customise how the settings panel is displayed by
overriding :meth:`App.display_settings` which is called before
displaying the settings panel on the screen. By default, it
simply draws the panel on top of the window, but you could modify it
to (for instance) show the settings in a
:class:`~kivy.uix.popup.Popup` or add it to your app's
:class:`~kivy.uix.screenmanager.ScreenManager` if you are using
one. If you do so, you should also modify :meth:`App.close_settings`
to exit the panel appropriately. For instance, to have the settings
panel appear in a popup you can do::

    def display_settings(self, settings):
        try:
            p = self.settings_popup
        except AttributeError:
            self.settings_popup = Popup(content=settings,
                                        title='Settings',
                                        size_hint=(0.8, 0.8))
            p = self.settings_popup
        if p.content is not settings:
            p.content = settings
        p.open()

    def close_settings(self, *args):
        try:
            p = self.settings_popup
            p.dismiss()
        except AttributeError:
            pass # Settings popup doesn't exist

Finally, if you want to replace the current settings panel widget, you
can remove the internal references to it using
:meth:`App.destroy_settings`. If you have modified
:meth:`App.display_settings`, you should be careful to detect if the
settings panel has been replaced.

Pause mode
----------

.. versionadded:: 1.1.0

On tablets and phones, the user can switch at any moment to another
application. By default, your application will close and the
:meth:`App.on_stop` event will be fired.

If you support Pause mode, when switching to another application, your
application will wait indefinitely until the user
switches back to your application. There is an issue with OpenGL on Android
devices: it is not guaranteed that the OpenGL ES Context will be restored when
your app resumes. The mechanism for restoring all the OpenGL data is not yet
implemented in Kivy.

The currently implemented Pause mechanism is:

    #. Kivy checks every frame if Pause mode is activated by the Operating
       System due to the user switching to another application, a phone
       shutdown or any other reason.
    #. :meth:`App.on_pause` is called:
    #. If False is returned, then :meth:`App.on_stop` is called.
    #. If True is returned (default case), the application will sleep until
       the OS resumes our App.
    #. When the app is resumed, :meth:`App.on_resume` is called.
    #. If our app memory has been reclaimed by the OS, then nothing will be
       called.

Here is a simple example of how on_pause() should be used::

   class TestApp(App):

      def on_pause(self):
         # Here you can save data if needed
         return True

      def on_resume(self):
         # Here you can check if any data needs replacing (usually nothing)
         pass

.. warning::

    Both `on_pause` and `on_stop` must save important data because after
    `on_pause` is called, `on_resume` may not be called at all.

Asynchronous app
----------------

In addition to running an app normally,
Kivy can be run within an async event loop such as provided by the standard
library asyncio package or the trio package (highly recommended).

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

Normally, when a Kivy app is run, it blocks the thread that runs it until the
app exits. Internally, at each clock iteration it executes all the app
callbacks, handles graphics and input, and idles by sleeping for any remaining
time.

To be able to run asynchronously, the Kivy app may not sleep, but instead must
release control of the running context to the asynchronous event loop running
the Kivy app. We do this when idling by calling the appropriate functions of
the async package being used instead of sleeping.

Async configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a Kivy app asynchronously, either the :func:`async_runTouchApp` or
:meth:`App.async_run` coroutine must be scheduled to run in the event loop of
the async library being used.

The environmental variable ``KIVY_EVENTLOOP`` or the ``async_lib`` parameter in
:func:`async_runTouchApp` and :meth:`App.async_run` set the async
library that Kivy uses internally when the app is run with
:func:`async_runTouchApp` and :meth:`App.async_run`. It can be set to one of
`"asyncio"` when the standard library `asyncio` is used, or `"trio"` if the
trio library is used. If the environment variable is not set and ``async_lib``
is not provided, the stdlib ``asyncio`` is used.

:meth:`~kivy.clock.ClockBaseBehavior.init_async_lib` can also be directly
called to set the async library to use, but it may only be called before the
app has begun running with :func:`async_runTouchApp` or :meth:`App.async_run`.

To run the app asynchronously, one schedules :func:`async_runTouchApp`
or :meth:`App.async_run` to run within the given library's async event loop as
in the examples shown below. Kivy is then treated as just another coroutine
that the given library runs in its event loop. Internally, Kivy will use the
specified async library's API, so ``KIVY_EVENTLOOP`` or ``async_lib`` must
match the async library that is running Kivy.


For a fuller basic and more advanced examples, see the demo apps in
``examples/async``.

Asyncio example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~--

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio

    from kivy.app import async_runTouchApp
    from kivy.uix.label import Label


    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(
        async_runTouchApp(Label(text='Hello, World!'), async_lib='asyncio'))
    loop.close()

Trio example
~~~~~~~~~~--

.. code-block:: python

    import trio

    from kivy.app import async_runTouchApp
    from kivy.uix.label import Label

    from functools import partial

    # use functools.partial() to pass keyword arguments:
    async_runTouchApp_func = partial(async_runTouchApp, async_lib='trio')

    trio.run(async_runTouchApp_func, Label(text='Hello, World!'))

Interacting with Kivy app from other coroutines
-----------------------------------------------

It is fully safe to interact with any kivy object from other coroutines
running within the same async event loop. This is because they are all running
from the same thread and the other coroutines are only executed when Kivy
is idling.

Similarly, the kivy callbacks may safely interact with objects from other
coroutines running in the same event loop. Normal single threaded rules apply
to both case.
