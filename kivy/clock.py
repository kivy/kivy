Clock object
============

The :class:`Clock` object allows you to schedule a function call in the
future; once or repeatedly at specified intervals. You can get the time
elapsed between the scheduling and the calling of the callback via the
`dt` argument::

    # dt means delta-time
    def my_callback(dt):
        pass

    # call my_callback every 0.5 seconds
    Clock.schedule_interval(my_callback, 0.5)

    # call my_callback in 5 seconds
    Clock.schedule_once(my_callback, 5)

    # call my_callback as soon as possible (usually next frame.)
    Clock.schedule_once(my_callback)

.. note::

    If the callback returns False, the schedule will be removed.

If you want to schedule a function to call with default arguments, you can use
the `functools.partial
<http://docs.python.org/library/functools.html#functools.partial>`_ python
module::

    from functools import partial

    def my_callback(value, key, *largs):
        pass

    Clock.schedule_interval(partial(my_callback, 'my value', 'my key'), 0.5)

Conversely, if you want to schedule a function that doesn't accept the dt
argument, you can use a `lambda
<http://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#lambda>`_ expression
to write a short function that does accept dt. For Example::

    def no_args_func():
        print("I accept no arguments, so don't schedule me in the clock")

    Clock.schedule_once(lambda dt: no_args_func(), 0.5)

.. note::

    You cannot unschedule an anonymous function unless you keep a
    reference to it.  It's better to add \*args to your function
    definition so that it can be called with an arbitrary number of
    parameters.

.. important::

    The callback is weak-referenced: you are responsible for keeping a
    reference to your original object/callback. If you don't keep a
    reference, the ClockBase will never execute your callback. For
    example::

        class Foo(object):
            def start(self):
                Clock.schedule_interval(self.callback, 0.5)

            def callback(self, dt):
                print('In callback')

        # A Foo object is created and the method start is called.
        # Because no reference is kept to the instance returned from Foo(),
        # the object will be collected by the Python Garbage Collector and
        # your callback will be never called.
        Foo().start()

        # So you should do the following and keep a reference to the instance
        # of foo until you don't need it anymore!
        foo = Foo()
        foo.start()


.. _schedule-before-frame:

Schedule before frame
---------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.0.5

Sometimes you need to schedule a callback BEFORE the next frame. Starting
from 1.0.5, you can use a timeout of -1::

    Clock.schedule_once(my_callback, 0) # call after the next frame
    Clock.schedule_once(my_callback, -1) # call before the next frame

The Clock will execute all the callbacks with a timeout of -1 before the
next frame even if you add a new callback with -1 from a running
callback.  However, :class:`Clock` has an iteration limit for these
callbacks: it defaults to 10.

If you schedule a callback that schedules a callback that schedules a .. etc
more than 10 times, it will leave the loop and send a warning to the console,
then continue after the next frame. This is implemented to prevent bugs from
hanging or crashing the application.

If you need to increase the limit, set the :attr:`max_iteration` property::

    from kivy.clock import Clock
    Clock.max_iteration = 20

.. _triggered-events:

Triggered Events
----------------

.. versionadded:: 1.0.5

A triggered event is a way to defer a callback exactly like schedule_once(),
but with some added convenience. The callback will only be scheduled once per
frame even if you call the trigger twice (or more). This is not the case
with :meth:`Clock.schedule_once`::

    # will run the callback twice before the next frame
    Clock.schedule_once(my_callback)
    Clock.schedule_once(my_callback)

    # will run the callback once before the next frame
    t = Clock.create_trigger(my_callback)
    t()
    t()

Before triggered events, you may have used this approach in a widget::

    def trigger_callback(self, *largs):
        Clock.unschedule(self.callback)
        Clock.schedule_once(self.callback)

As soon as you call `trigger_callback()`, it will correctly schedule the
callback once in the next frame. It is more convenient to create and bind to
the triggered event than using :meth:`Clock.schedule_once` in a function::

    from kivy.clock import Clock
    from kivy.uix.widget import Widget

    class Sample(Widget):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            self._trigger = Clock.create_trigger(self.cb)
            super(Sample, self).__init__(**kwargs)
            self.bind(x=self._trigger, y=self._trigger)

        def cb(self, *largs):
            pass

Even if x and y changes within one frame, the callback is only run once.

.. note::

    :meth:`ClockBase.create_trigger` also has a timeout parameter that
    behaves exactly like :meth:`ClockBase.schedule_once`.

Threading
----------

.. versionadded:: 1.9.0

Often, other threads are used to schedule callbacks with kivy's main thread
using :class:`ClockBase`. Therefore, it's important to know what is thread safe
and what isn't.

All the :class:`ClockBase` and :class:`ClockEvent` methods are safe with
respect to kivy's thread. That is, it's always safe to call these methods
from a single thread that is not the kivy thread. However, there are no
guarantees as to the order in which these callbacks will be executed.

Calling a previously created trigger from two different threads (even if one
of them is the kivy thread), or calling the trigger and its
:meth:`ClockEvent.cancel` method from two different threads at the same time is
not safe. That is, although no exception will be raised, there no guarantees
that calling the trigger from two different threads will not result in the
callback being executed twice, or not executed at all. Similarly, such issues
might arise when calling the trigger and canceling it with
:meth:`ClockBase.unschedule` or :meth:`ClockEvent.cancel` from two threads
simultaneously.

Therefore, it is safe to call :meth:`ClockBase.create_trigger`,
:meth:`ClockBase.schedule_once`, :meth:`ClockBase.schedule_interval`, or
call or cancel a previously created trigger from an external thread.
The following code, though, is not safe because it calls or cancels
from two threads simultaneously without any locking mechanism::

    event = Clock.create_trigger(func)

    # in thread 1
    event()
    # in thread 2
    event()
    # now, the event may be scheduled twice or once

    # the following is also unsafe
    # in thread 1
    event()
    # in thread 2
    event.cancel()
    # now, the event may or may not be scheduled and a subsequent call
    # may schedule it twice

Note, in the code above, thread 1 or thread 2 could be the kivy thread, not
just an external thread.
