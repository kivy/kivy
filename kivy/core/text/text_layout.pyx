Text layout

    '''Formally describes a word contained in a line. The name word simply
    means a chunk of text and can be used to describe any text.

    A word has some width, height and is rendered according to options saved
    in :attr:`options`. See :class:`LayoutLine` for its usage.

    :Parameters:
        `options`: dict
            the label options dictionary for this word.
        `lw`: int
            the width of the text in pixels.
        `lh`: int
            the height of the text in pixels.
        `text`: string
            the text of the word.

cdef class LayoutLine:
    ''' Formally describes a line of text. A line of text is composed of many
    :class:`LayoutWord` instances, each with it's own text, size and options.

    A :class:`LayoutLine` instance does not always imply that the words
    contained in the line ended with a newline. That is only the case if
    :attr:`is_last_line` is True. For example a single real line of text can
    be split across multiple :class:`LayoutLine` instances if the whole line
    doesn't fit in the constrained width.

    :Parameters:
        `x`: int
            the location in a texture from where the left side of this line is
            began drawn.
        `y`: int
            the location in a texture from where the bottom of this line is
            drawn.
        `w`: int
            the width of the line. This is the sum of the individual widths
            of its :class:`LayoutWord` instances. Does not include any padding.
        `h`: int
            the height of the line. This is the maximum of the individual
            heights of its :class:`LayoutWord` instances multiplied by the
            `line_height` of these instance. So this is larger then the word
            height.
        `is_last_line`: bool
            whether this line was the last line in a paragraph. When True, it
            implies that the line was followed by a newline. Newlines should
            not be included in the text of words, but is implicit by setting
            this to True.
        `line_wrap`: bool
            whether this line is continued from a previous line which didn't
            fit into a constrained width and was therefore split across
            multiple :class:`LayoutLine` instances. `line_wrap` can be True
            or False independently of `is_last_line`.
        `words`: python list
            a list that contains only :class:`LayoutWord` instances describing
            the text of the line.

def layout_text(object text, list lines, tuple size, tuple text_size,

                int complete):
    ''' Lays out text into a series of :class:`LayoutWord` and
    :class:`LayoutLine` instances according to the options specified.

    The function is designed to be called many times, each time new text is
    appended to the last line (or first line if appending upwards), unless a
    newline is present in the text. Each text appended is described by it's own
    options which can change between successive calls. If the text is
    constrained, we stop as soon as the constraint is reached.

    :Parameters:
        `text`: string or bytes
            the text to be broken down into lines. If lines is not empty,
            the text is added to the last line (or first line if `append_down`
            is False) until a newline is reached which creates a new line in
            `lines`. See :class:`LayoutLine`.
        `lines`: list
            a list of :class:`LayoutLine` instances, each describing a line of
            the text. Calls to :func:`layout_text` append or create
            new :class:`LayoutLine` instances in `lines`.
        `size`: 2-tuple of ints
            the size of the laid out text so far. Upon first call it should
            probably be (0, 0), afterwards it should be the (w, h) returned
            by this function in a previous call. When size reaches the
            constraining size, `text_size`, we stop adding lines and return
            True for the clipped parameter. size includes the x and y padding.
        `text_size`: 2-tuple of ints or None.
            the size constraint on the laid out text. If either element is
            None, the text is not constrained in that dimension. For example,
            (None, 200) will constrain the height, including padding to 200,
            while the width is unconstrained. The first line, and the first
            character of a line is always returned, even if it exceeds the
            constraint. The value be changed between different calls.
        `options`: dict
            the label options of this `text`. The options are saved with each
            word allowing different words to have different options from
            successive calls.

            Note, `options` must include a `space_width` key with a value
            indicating the width of a space for that set of options.
        `get_extents`: callable
            a function called with a string, which returns a tuple containing
            the width, height of the string.
        `append_down`: bool
            Whether successive calls to the function appends lines before or
            after the existing lines. If True, they are appended to the last
            line and below it. If False, it's appended at the first line and
            above. For example, if False, everything after the last
            newline in `text` is appended to the first line in lines.
            Everything before the last newline is inserted at the start of
            lines in same order as text; that is we do not invert the line
            order.

            This allows laying out from top to bottom until the constrained is
            reached, or from bottom to top until the constrained is reached.
        `complete`: bool
            whether this text complete lines. It use is that normally is
            strip in `options` is True, all leading and trailing spaces
            are removed from each line except from the last line (or first
            line if `append_down` is False) which only removes leading spaces.
            That's because further text can still be appended to the last line
            so we cannot strip them. If `complete` is True, it indicates no
            further text is coming and all lines will be stripped.

            The function can also be called with `text` set to the empty string
            and `complete` set to True in order for the last (first) line to
            be stripped.

    :returns:
        3-tuple, (w, h, clipped).
        w and h is the width and height of the text in lines so far and
        includes padding. This can be larger than `text_size`, e.g. if not even
        a single fitted, the first line would still be returned.
        `clipped` is True if not all the text has been added to lines because
        w, h reached the constrained size.

    Following is a simple example with no padding and no stripping::

        >>> from kivy.core.text import Label
        >>> from kivy.core.text.text_layout import layout_text

        >>> l = Label()
        >>> lines = []
        >>> # layout text with width constraint by 50, but no height constraint
        >>> w, h, clipped = layout_text('heres some text\\nah, another line',
        ... lines, (0, 0), (50, None), l.options, l.get_cached_extents(), True,
        ... False)
        >>> w, h, clipped
        (46, 90, False)
        # now add text from bottom up, and constrain witdh only be 100
        >>> w, h, clipped = layout_text('\\nyay, more text\\n', lines, (w, h),
        ... (100, None), l.options, l.get_cached_extents(), False, True)
