'''CSS-like Rule Selectors
=======================

The Kivy language allows you to write rules that may be selected depending
on context.  These rules use a very small subset of CSS3 selectors.  For
example::

    <<A B.p1.p2 > C *#i3>>:
        ...

Such a rule applies to any (`*`) widget with `id=i3`, that is a descendant of a
widget whose Python class inherits from `C`, which itself is an immediate child
of a widget whose python class inherits from `B` and whose `cls` property has
elements `p1`and `p2`, and which itself is a descendant of a widget whose Python
class inherits from `A`.

Here is a (not very good) example::

    ScreenManager:
        Screen:
            id: one
        Screen:
            id: two
    
    <Screen>:
        id: screen
        BoxLayout:
            orientation: "vertical"
            id: screen-layout
            Label:
                id: banner
                size_hint: 1,None
                height: dp(50)
            Button:
                id: button1
                screen: screen
    
    <<Screen#one>>:
        name: "un"
    
    <<Screen#two>>:
        name: "deux"
    
    <<Screen#one Label#banner>>:
        text: "Screen 1"
    
    <<Screen#two Label#banner>>:
        text: "Screen 2"
    
    <<Screen#one Button#button1>>:
        text: "To Screen 2"
        on_release:
            root.screen.manager.transition.direction = "left"
            root.screen.manager.current = "deux"
    
    <<Screen#two Button#button1>>:
        text: "To Screen 1"
        on_release:
            root.screen.manager.transition.direction = "right"
            root.screen.manager.current = "un"


It is also possible to use nesting of contextual rules: a nested contextual
rule inherits as a prefix the css selectors of the contextual rules it is
nested in.  For example, the above contextual rules could also equivalently
be written as follows::

    <<Screen#one>>:
        name: "un"
        <<Label#banner>>:
            text: "Screen 1"
        <<Button#button1>>:
            text: "To Screen 2"
            on_release:
                root.screen.manager.transition.direction = "left"
                root.screen.manager.current = "deux"
    
    <<Screen#two>>:
        name: "deux"
        <<Label#banner>>:
            text: "Screen 2"
        <<Button#button1>>:
            text: "To Screen 1"
            on_release:
                root.screen.manager.transition.direction = "right"
                root.screen.manager.current = "un"


Caveats
-------

Since widgets, created from kv-lang specifications, get their properties very
late (too late for rule selection), class selectors and id selectors also
consult the information stored in the rule responsible for creatng the widget.
If that information can be evaluated statically, then it can influence rule
selection (presence of an `id` or `cls` property).

After rule selection has occurred, the selected rules will also be used to
get more precise information about `id` and `cls` before they have taken effect
on the widget.  In this fashion, the context for descendent widgets becomes
more precise.

If you don't use contextual rules, nothing changes.  However, if you do, then
the rule match cache is deactivated; it probably won't have a measurable
incidence on your application, but "caveat emptor!".

A widget that is created from Python code, rather than in from a kv-lang
specification, does not have a context in which to evaluate contextual rules
that might or might not apply to it.  For this reason, the :class:`Widget`
constructor also accepts a `css_ctx` keyword parameter whose value maybe
either the intended :class:`Widget` parent or an explicit :class:`CSSCtx`
instance describing the hierarchy into which the new widget will be
inserted.
