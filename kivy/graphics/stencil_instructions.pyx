Stencil instructions
====================

.. versionadded:: 1.0.4

.. versionchanged:: 1.3.0

    The stencil operation have been updated to resolve some issues appearing
    when nested. You **must** know have a StencilUnUse and repeat the same
    operation as you did after StencilPush.

Stencil instructions permit you to draw and use the current drawing as a mask.
Even if you don't have as much control as OpenGL, you can still do fancy things
:=)

The stencil buffer can be controled with theses 3 instructions :

    - :class:`StencilPush`: push a new stencil layer
      any drawing that happening here will be used as a mask
    - :class:`StencilUse` : now draw the next instructions and use the stencil
      for masking them
    - :class:`StencilUnUse` : stop drawing, and use the stencil to remove the
      mask
    - :class:`StencilPop` : pop the current stencil layer.


Here is a global scheme to respect::

.. code-block:: kv

    StencilPush

    # PHASE 1: put here any drawing instruction to use as a mask

    StencilUse

    # PHASE 2: all the drawing here will be automatically clipped by the previous mask

    StencilUnUse

    # PHASE 3: put here the same drawing instruction as you did in PHASE 1

    StencilPop



Limitations
-----------

- Drawing in PHASE 1 and PHASE 3 must not collide between each others, or you
  will get unexpected result.
- The stencil is activated as soon as you're doing a StencilPush
- The stencil is deactivated as soon as you've correctly pop all the stencils
  layers
- You must not play with stencil yourself between a StencilPush / StencilPop
- You can push again the stencil after a StencilUse / before the StencilPop
- You can push up to 128 layers of stencils. (8 for kivy < 1.3.0)


Example of stencil usage
------------------------

Here is an example, in kv style::

    StencilPush

    # create a rectangle mask, from pos 100, 100, with a 100, 100 size.
    Rectangle:
        pos: 100, 100
        size: 100, 100

    StencilUse

    # we want to show a big green rectangle, however, the previous stencil
    # mask will crop us :)
    Color:
        rgb: 0, 1, 0
    Rectangle:
        size: 900, 900

    StencilUnUse:
        # new in kivy 1.3.0, remove the mask previoulsy added
        Rectangle:
            pos: 100, 100
            size: 100, 100

    StencilPop
