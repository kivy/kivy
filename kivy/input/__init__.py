Input management
================

Our input system is wide and simple at the same time. We are currently able to
natively support :

* Windows multitouch events (pencil and finger)
* OS X touchpads
* Linux multitouch events (kernel and mtdev)
* Linux wacom drivers (pencil and finger)
* TUIO

All the input management is configurable in the Kivy :mod:`~kivy.config`. You
can easily use many multitouch devices in one Kivy application.

When the events have been read from the devices, they are dispatched through
a post processing module before being sent to your application. We also have
several default modules for :

* Double tap detection
* Decreasing jittering
* Decreasing the inaccuracy of touch on "bad" DIY hardware
* Ignoring regions

If your application don't use input or post processing you can remove the
respective config file sections. If you remove just `[input]` section, it will
disable `[postproc]` as a side-effect. Removing just `[postproc]` section will
prevent only postproc modules to load.
