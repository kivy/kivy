/* The basic operations are insertion of a new key (pqInsert),
* and examination/extraction of a key whose value is minimum
* (pqMinimum/pqExtractMin).  Deletion is also allowed (pqDelete);
* for this purpose pqInsert returns a "handle" which is supplied
* as the argument.
*
* An initial heap may be created efficiently by calling pqInsert
* repeatedly, then calling pqInit.  In any case pqInit must be called
* before any operations other than pqInsert are used.
*
* If the heap is empty, pqMinimum/pqExtractMin will return a NULL key.
* This may also be tested with pqIsEmpty.
*/

/* Since we support deletion the data structure is a little more
* complicated than an ordinary heap.  "nodes" is the heap itself;
* active nodes are stored in the range 1..pq->size.  When the
* heap exceeds its allocated size (pq->max), its size doubles.
* The children of node i are nodes 2i and 2i+1.
*
* Each node stores an index into an array "handles".  Each handle
* stores a key, plus a pointer back to the node which currently
* represents that key (ie. nodes[handles[i].node].handle == i).
