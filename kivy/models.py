Data Models

.. warning::

    This code is still experimental, and its API is subject to change in a
    future version.

Data Model Classes
------------------

Kivy is open about the type of data used in applications built with the system.
However, base classes are needed for use with the selection system.

A :class:`SelectableDataItem` can be used as a mixin to build data objects that
are compatible with Kivy's selection system, which works with adapters and
similar classes, and with views such as a :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListView`.
The ksel attribute is a requirement.

The default operation of the selection system is to not propogate selection of
view instances in views such as ListView to the underlying data -- selection is
by default a view-only operation (VIEW_ON_DATA selection scheme). However, in
some cases, it is useful to propogate selection to the actual data items, and
vice versa. Learn about the classes here in combination with reading the docs
for Selection, and selection schemes.

You may build your own Python data model system as the backend for a Kivy
application. Add a SelectionTool attr called ksel to implement selection.

For selection schemes involving data items that completely drive selection
(DATA_DRIVEN), or that are in a two-way coupling with views
(DATA_VIEW_COUPLED).

.. versionchanged:: 1.8

    Moved to kivy/, because models are not specific to adapters.
