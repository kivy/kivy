Widgets
=======

A widget is an element of a graphical user interface.

The `kivy.uix` module contains classes for creating and arranging Widgets. 

If you don't know anything about widgets, you should start by reading the
:class:`~kivy.uix.widget.Widget` documentation.

If you need to arrange widgets on the screen, start by reading the
:class:`~kivy.uix.layout.Layout` documentation.
