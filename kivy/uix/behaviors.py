'''
Behaviors
=========

.. versionadded:: 1.8.0

This module implements behaviors that can be mixed with existing base widgets.
For example, if you want to add a "button" capability to an `Image`, you could
do::


    class IconButton(ButtonBehavior, Image):
        pass

.. note::

    The behavior class must always be _before_ the widget class. If you don't
    specify the inheritance in this order, the behavior will not work because
    the behavior methods are overwritten by the class method listed first.

    Similarly, if you combine a behavior class with a class which
    requires the use of the methods also defined by the behavior class, the
    resulting class may not function properly. E.g. combining a ButtonBehavior
    with a Slider, both of which require the on_touch_up methods, the resulting
    class will not work.

class FocusBehavior(object):
    '''Implements keyboard focus behavior. When combined with other
    FocusBehavior widgets it allows one to cycle focus among them by pressing
    tab. In addition, upon gaining focus the instance will automatically
    receive keyboard input.

    Focus, very different then selection, is intimately tied with the keyboard;
    each keyboard can focus on zero or one widgets, and each widget can only
    have the focus of one keyboard. However, multiple keyboards can focus
    simultaneously on different widgets. When escape is hit, the widget having
    the focus of that keyboard will de-focus.

    In essence, focus is implemented as a doubly linked list, where each
    node holds a (weak) reference to the instance before it and after it,
    as visualized when cycling through the nodes using tab (forward) or
    shift+tab (backward). If previous or next widget is not specified,
    :attr:`focus_next` and :attr:`focus_previous` defaults to `None`,
    which means that the children list and parents are walked to find
    the next focusable widget, unless :attr:`focus_next` or
    :attr:`focus_previous` is set to the `StopIteration` class, in which case
    focus stops there.

    For example, to cycle focus between :class:`~kivy.uix.button.Button`
    elements of a :class:`~kivy.uix.gridlayout.GridLayout`::

        class FocusButton(FocusBehavior, Button):
            pass

        grid = GridLayout(cols=4)
        for i in range(40):
            grid.add_widget(FocusButton(text=str(i)))
        # clicking on a widget will activate focus, and tab can now be used
        # to cycle through

    None.

    .. note::

        When Config's `keyboard_mode` is multi, each new touch is considered
        a touch by a different user and will focus (if clicked on a
        focusable) with a new keyboard. Already focused elements will not lose
        their focus (even if clicked on a unfocusable).

    .. note:

        If the keyboard property is set, that keyboard will be used when the
        instance gets focused. If widgets with different keyboards are linked
        through :attr:`focus_next` and :attr:`focus_previous`, then as they are
        tabbed through, different keyboards will become active. Therefore,
        typically it's undesirable to link instances which are assigned
        different keyboards.

    .. note:

        When an instance has focus, setting keyboard to None will remove the
        current keyboard, but will then try to get a keyboard back. It is
        better to set :attr:`focus` to False.

    .. warning:

        When assigning a keyboard, the keyboard must not be released while
        it is still assigned to an instance. Similarly, the keyboard created
        by the instance on focus and assigned to :attr:`keyboard` if None,
        will be released by the instance when the instance loses focus.
        Therefore, it is not safe to assign this keyboard to another instance's
        :attr:`keyboard`.

    '''Selection behavior implements the logic behind keyboard and touch
    selection of selectable widgets managed by the derived widget.
    For example, it could be combined with a
    :class:`~kivy.uix.gridlayout.GridLayout` to add selection to the layout.

    At its core, it keeps a dynamic list of widgets that can be selected.
    Then, as the touches and keyboard input are passed in, it selects one or
    more of the widgets based on these inputs. For example, it uses the mouse
    scroll and keyboard up/down buttons to scroll through the list of widgets.
    Multiselection can also be achieved using the keyboard shift and ctrl keys.
    Finally, in addition to the up/down type keyboard inputs, it can also
    accepts letters from the kayboard to be used to select nodes with
    associated strings that start with those letters, similar to how files
    are selected by a file browser.

    When the controller needs to select a node it calls :meth:`select_node` and
    :meth:`deselect_node`. Therefore, they must be overwritten in order affect
    the selected nodes. By default, the class doesn't listen to keyboard and
    touch events, therefore, the derived widget must call
    :meth:`select_with_touch`, :meth:`select_with_key_down`, and
    :meth:`select_with_key_up` on events that it wants to pass on for selection
    purposes.

    For example, to add selection to a grid layout which will contain
    :class:`~kivy.uix.Button` widgets::

        class SelectableGrid(CompoundSelectionBehavior, GridLayout):

            def __init__(self, **kwargs):
                super(CompoundSelectionBehavior, self).__init__(**kwargs)
                keyboard = Window.request_keyboard(None, self)
                keyboard.bind(on_key_down=self.select_with_key_down,
                on_key_up=self.select_with_key_up)

            def select_node(self, node):
                node.background_color = (1, 0, 0, 1)
                return super(CompoundSelectionBehavior, self).select_node(node)

            def deselect_node(self, node):
                node.background_color = (1, 1, 1, 1)
                super(CompoundSelectionBehavior, self).deselect_node(node)

    Then, for each button added to the layout, bind on_touch_down of the button
    to :meth:`select_with_touch` to pass on the touch events.
