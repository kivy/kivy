'''
Behaviors
=========

.. versionadded:: 1.8.0

This module implements behaviors that can be mixed with existing base widgets.
For example, if you want to add a "button" capability to an `Image`, you could
do::


    class IconButton(ButtonBehavior, Image):
        pass

.. note::

    The behavior class must always be _before_ the widget class. If you don't
    specify the inheritance in this order, the behavior will not work.
