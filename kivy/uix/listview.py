'''
List View
=========

.. versionadded:: 1.5

.. warning::

    This code is still experimental, and its API is subject to change in a
    future version.

The :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListView` widget provides a scrollable/pannable
viewport that is clipped to the scrollview's bounding box which contains
list item view instances.

The :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListView` implements an :class:`AbstractView` as
a vertical, scrollable list. The :class:`AbstractView` has one property:
:class:`~kivy.adapters.adapter`.
The :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListView` sets an adapter to one of a
:class:`~kivy.adapters.simplelistadapter.SimpleListAdapter`,
:class:`~kivy.adapters.listadapter.ListAdapter` or a
:class:`~kivy.adapters.dictadapter.DictAdapter`.

.. versionchanged:: 1.8.0

    The underlying adapter and selection system were changed in support of
    operations here, which needed to receive more detailed information about
    changes to data held in adapters, either in ListAdapter or DictAdapter. The
    data_changed() method replaces a call to bind_triggers_to_view(), now
    removed. Previously, with limited information about data change, only broad
    scrolling and child handling reactions could be made. Now, in the new
    data_changed() method, there is an opportunity to react to individual item
    resets, to insertions, deletions, sort, etc. For these reactions, sometimes
    it is necessary to remove and force re-creation of views, sometimes it is
    necessary to make a specific scroll action, and so on.

    Removed ListItemLabel.

    SelectableView now subclasses ButtonBehavior, and has a
    carry_selection_to_children property.

    CompositeListItem now has a bind_selection_from_children property. Also,
    its is_representing_cls is now removed.

    For scrolling, added scroll_advance. Removed _count, which was unused.

Introduction
------------

Lists are central parts of many software projects. Kivy's approach to lists
includes providing solutions for simple lists, along with a substantial
framework for building lists of moderate to advanced complexity. For a new
user, it can be difficult to ramp up from simple to advanced. For
this reason, Kivy provides an extensive set of examples that you may wish to
run first, to get a taste of the range of functionality offered. You can tell
from the names of the examples that they illustrate the "ramping up" from
simple to advanced:

    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_simple.py
    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_simple_in_kv.py
    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_simple_in_kv_2.py
    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_master_detail.py
    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_two_up.py
    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_kv.py
    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_composite.py
    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_cascade.py
    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_cascade_dict.py
    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_cascade_images.py
    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_scroll.py
    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_ops.py
    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_reset_data.py
    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_data_changes.py
    * kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_of_carousels.py

Many of the examples feature selection, some restricting selection to single
selection, where only one item at at time can be selected, and others allowing
multiple item selection. Many of the examples illustrate how selection in one
list can be connected to actions and selections in another view or another list.

Find your own way of reading the documentation here, examining the source code
for the example apps and running the examples. Some may prefer to read the
documentation through first, others may want to run the examples and view their
code. No matter what you do, going back and forth will likely be needed.

Basic Example
-------------

In its simplest form, we make a listview with 100 items::

    from kivy.uix.listview import ListView
    from kivy.uix.gridlayout import GridLayout


    class MainView(GridLayout):

        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            kwargs['cols'] = 2
            super(MainView, self).__init__(**kwargs)

            list_view = ListView(
                item_strings=[str(index) for index in range(100)])

            self.add_widget(list_view)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from kivy.base import runTouchApp
        runTouchApp(MainView(width=800))

Or, we could declare the listview using the kv language::

    from kivy.uix.modalview import ModalView
    from kivy.uix.listview import ListView
    from kivy.uix.gridlayout import GridLayout
    from kivy.lang import Builder

    Builder.load_string("""
    <ListViewModal>:
        size_hint: None, None
        size: 400, 400
        ListView:
            size_hint: .8, .8
            item_strings: [str(index) for index in range(100)]
    """)


    class ListViewModal(ModalView):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super(ListViewModal, self).__init__(**kwargs)


    class MainView(GridLayout):

        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            kwargs['cols'] = 1
            super(MainView, self).__init__(**kwargs)

            listview_modal = ListViewModal()

            self.add_widget(listview_modal)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from kivy.base import runTouchApp
        runTouchApp(MainView(width=800))

Using an Adapter
-------------------

Behind the scenes, the basic example above uses the
:class:`~kivy.adapters.simplelistadapter.SimpleListAdapter`. When the
constructor for the :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListView` sees that only a list
of
strings is provided as an argument (called item_strings), it creates an instance
of :class:`~kivy.adapters.simplelistadapter.SimpleListAdapter` using the
list of strings.

Simple in :class:`~kivy.adapters.simplelistadapter.SimpleListAdapter` means:
*without selection support*. It is a scrollable list of items that does not
respond to touch events.

To use a :class:`SimpleListAdaper` explicitly when creating a ListView instance,
do::

    simple_list_adapter = SimpleListAdapter(
            data=["Item #{0}".format(i) for i in range(100)],
            cls=Label)

    list_view = ListView(adapter=simple_list_adapter)

The instance of :class:`~kivy.adapters.simplelistadapter.SimpleListAdapter` has
a required data argument which contains data items to use for instantiating
Label views for the list view (note the cls=Label argument). The data items are
strings. Each item string is set by the
:class:`~kivy.adapters.simplelistadapter.SimpleListAdapter` as the *text*
argument for each Label instantiation.

You can declare a ListView with an adapter in a kv file with special attention
given to the way longer python blocks are indented::

    from kivy.uix.modalview import ModalView
    from kivy.uix.listview import ListView
    from kivy.uix.gridlayout import GridLayout
    from kivy.lang import Builder
    from kivy.factory import Factory

    # Note the special nature of indentation in the adapter declaration, where
    # the adapter: is on one line, then the value side must be given at one
    # level of indentation.

    Builder.load_string("""
    #:import label kivy.uix.label
    #:import sla kivy.adapters.simplelistadapter

    <ListViewModal>:
        size_hint: None, None
        size: 400, 400
        ListView:
            size_hint: .8, .8
            adapter:
                sla.SimpleListAdapter(
                data=["Item #{0}".format(i) for i in range(100)],
                cls=label.Label)
    """)


    class ListViewModal(ModalView):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super(ListViewModal, self).__init__(**kwargs)


    class MainView(GridLayout):

        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            kwargs['cols'] = 1
            super(MainView, self).__init__(**kwargs)

            listview_modal = ListViewModal()

            self.add_widget(listview_modal)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from kivy.base import runTouchApp
        runTouchApp(MainView(width=800))

ListAdapter and DictAdapter
---------------------------

For many uses of a list, the data is more than a simple list of strings.
Selection functionality is also often needed.
The :class:`~kivy.adapters.listadapter.ListAdapter` and
:class:`~kivy.adapters.dictadapter.DictAdapter` cover these more elaborate
needs.

:class:`~kivy.adapters.listadapter.ListAdapter` is simpler than
:class:`~kivy.adapters.dictadapter.DictAdapter`, so we can start with it.

See the :class:`~kivy.adapters.listadapter.ListAdapter` docs for details, but
here are synopses of its arguments:

* *data*: strings, class instances, dicts, etc. that form the basis data
  for instantiating views.

* *cls*: a Kivy view that is to be instantiated for each list item. There
  are several built-in types available, including ListItemLabel and
  ListItemButton, or you can make your own class that mixes in the
  required :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.SelectableView`.

* *template*: the name of a Kivy language (kv) template that defines the
  Kivy view for each list item.

.. note::

    Pick only one, cls or template, to provide as an argument.

* *args_converter*: a function that takes a data item object as input and
  uses it to build and return an args dict, ready
  to be used in a call to instantiate item views using the item view cls
  or template. In the case of cls, the args dict acts as a
  kwargs object. For a template, it is treated as a context
  (ctx) but is essentially similar in form to the kwargs usage.

* *selection_mode*: a string with the value 'single', 'multiple' or others
  (See :attr:`~kivy.adapters.listadapter.ListAdapter.selection_mode` for
  details).

* *allow_empty_selection*: a boolean, which if False (the default), forces
  there to always be a selection if there is data
  available. If True, selection happens only as a
  result of user action.

In narrative, we can summarize as follows:

    A listview's adapter takes data items and uses an args_converter
    function to transform them into arguments for making list item view
    instances, using either a cls or a kv template.

In a graphic, a summary of the relationship between a listview and its
list adapter, looks like this::

    -                    ------------ ListAdapter or DictAdapter ------------
    -                    |                                                  |
    -                    | <list item views> (cls or template) <data items> |
    -   ListView   -->   |                           [args_converter]       |
    -                    |                                                  |
    -                    |           <<< selection handling >>>             |
    -                    |                                                  |
    -                    ----------------------------------------------------

:class:`~kivy.adapters.dictadapter.DictAdapter` has the same arguments and
requirements as :class:`~kivy.adapters.listadapter.ListAdapter`, except:

1) There is an additional argument, sorted_keys, which must meet the
   requirements of normal python dictionary keys.

2) The data argument is, as you would expect, a dict. Keys in the dict
   must include the keys in the sorted_keys argument, but they may form a
   superset of the keys in sorted_keys. Values may be strings, class
   instances, dicts, etc. (The args_converter uses it accordingly).

3) The args_converter receives an additional arg, the dict key. For
   ListAdapter, the calling signature for an args_converter is:

       args_converter(index, data_item)

   but for DictAdapter, it is:

       args_converter(index, data_item, key)

Using an Args Converter
-----------------------

A :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListView` allows use of built-in list item views,
such as :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListItemButton`, your own custom item view
class or a custom kv template. Whichever type of list item view is used, an
args_converter function is needed to prepare, per list data item, args for
the cls or template.

.. note::

    ListItemLabel and ListItemButton, or custom classes like them, and not the
    bare Label nor Button classes, are to be used.

.. warning::

    ListItemButton inherits the `background_normal` and `background_down`
    properties from the Button widget, so the `selected_color` and
    `deselected_color` are not represented faithfully by default.

Here is an args_converter for ListAdapter, for use with the built-in
:class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListItemButton`, specified as a normal Python
function::

    def args_converter(index, an_obj):
        return {'text': an_obj.some_prop,
                'size_hint_y': None,
                'height': 25}

and as a lambda:

    args_converter = lambda index, an_obj: {'text': an_obj.some_prop,
                                            'size_hint_y': None,
                                            'height': 25}

In the args converter example above, the data item is assumed to be an object
(class instance), hence the reference an_obj.some_prop.

Here is an example of an args converter that works with list data items that
are dicts::

    args_converter = \
            lambda index, obj, key: {'text': key + '-' + obj.some_prop,
                                     'size_hint_y': None,
                                     'height': 25}

So, it is the responsibility of the developer to code the args_converter
according to the data at hand. The index argument can be useful in some
cases, such as when custom labels are needed.

An Example ListView
-------------------

Now, to some example code::

    from kivy.adapters.listadapter import ListAdapter
    from kivy.uix.listview import ListItemButton, ListView

    data = [{'text': str(i), 'is_selected': False} for i in range(100)]

    args_converter = lambda index, rec: {'text': rec['text'],
                                         'size_hint_y': None,
                                         'height': 25}

    list_adapter = ListAdapter(data=data,
                               args_converter=args_converter,
                               cls=ListItemButton,
                               selection_mode='single',
                               allow_empty_selection=False)

    list_view = ListView(adapter=list_adapter)

This listview will show 100 buttons with 0..100 labels. The args converter
function works on dict items (rec, for record) in the data. ListItemButton
views will be instantiated from the args converted by args_converter for each
data item. The listview will only allow single selection -- additional touches
will be ignored. When the listview is first shown, the first item will already
be selected, because allow_empty_selection is False.

The :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListItemLabel` works in much the same way as the
:class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListItemButton`.

Using a Custom Item View Class
------------------------------

The data used in an adapter can be any of the normal Python types, such as
strings, class instances and dictionaries. They can also be custom classes, as
shown below. It is up to the programmer to
assure that the args_converter performs the appropriate conversions.

Here we make a simple DataItem class:

    from kivy.uix.listview import ListItemButton

    class DataItem(SelectableDataItem):
        def __init__(self, text=''):
            self.text = text

    data_items = []
    data_items.append(DataItem(text='cat'))
    data_items.append(DataItem(text='dog'))
    data_items.append(DataItem(text='frog'))

    list_item_args_converter = lambda index, obj: {'text': obj.text,
                                                   'size_hint_y': None,
                                                   'height': 25}

    list_adapter = ListAdapter(data=data_items,
                               args_converter=list_item_args_converter,
                               selection_mode='single',
                               sync_with_model_data=True,
                               allow_empty_selection=False,
                               cls=ListItemButton)

    list_view = ListView(adapter=list_adapter)

The data is set in a :class:`~kivy.adapters.listadapter.ListAdapter` along with
a list item args_converter function above (a lambda) and arguments concerning
selection: only single selection is allowed, and selection in the listview will
sync with the data items. The sync setting means that the is_selected property
for each data item will be set and kept in sync with the list item views. By
having allow_empty_selection=False, when the listview first appears, the first
item, 'cat', will already be selected. The list adapter will instantiate a
:class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListItemButton` instance for each data item, using
the assigned args_converter.

The list_vew would be added to a view with add_widget() after the last line,
where it is created. See the basic example at the top of this documentation for
an example of add_widget() in the context of a sample app.

You may also use the provided :class:`SelectableDataItem` mixin to make a
custom class. Instead of the manually-constructed DataItem class above,
we could do::

    from kivy.adapters.models import SelectableDataItem

    class DataItem(SelectableDataItem):
        # Add properties here.

:class:`SelectableDataItem` is a simple mixin class that has an is_selected
property.

Using an Item View Template
---------------------------

:class:`~kivy.uix.listview.SelectableView` is another simple mixin class that
has required properties for a list item: text, and is_selected. To make your
own template, mix it in as follows::

    from kivy.uix.listview import ListItemButton
    from kivy.uix.listview import SelectableView

    Builder.load_string("""
    [CustomListItem@SelectableView+BoxLayout]:
        size_hint_y: ctx.size_hint_y
        height: ctx.height
        ListItemButton:
            text: ctx.text
            is_selected: ctx.is_selected
    """)

A class called CustomListItem will be instantiated for each list item. Note
that it is a layout, BoxLayout, and is thus a kind of container. It contains a
:class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListItemButton` instance.

Using the power of the Kivy language (kv), you can easily build composite list
items. In addition to ListItemButton, you could have a ListItemLabel, or a
custom class you have defined and registered with the system.

An args_converter needs to be constructed that goes along with such a kv
template. For example, to use the kv template above::

    list_item_args_converter = \
            lambda index, rec, key: {'text': key,
                                     'is_selected': rec['is_selected'],
                                     'size_hint_y': None,
                                     'height': 25}
    integers_dict = {str(i): {'is_selected': False} for i in range(100)}

    dict_adapter = DictAdapter(sorted_keys=[str(i) for i in range(100)],
                               data=integers_dict,
                               args_converter=list_item_args_converter,
                               template='CustomListItem')

    list_view = ListView(adapter=dict_adapter)

A dict adapter is created with 1..100 integer strings as sorted_keys, and an
integers_dict as data, a dict with str(i) keys and simple dict as values.
integers_dict has the integer strings as keys and dicts with text and
is_selected properties. The CustomListItem defined above in the
Builder.load_string() call is set as the kv template for the list item views.
The list_item_args_converter lambda function will take each dict in
integers_dict and will return an args dict, ready for passing as the context
(ctx) for the template.

The list_vew would be added to a view with add_widget() after the last line,
where it is created. Again, see the basic example above for add_widget() use.

Using CompositeListItem
-----------------------

The class :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.CompositeListItem` is another option for
building advanced composite list items. The kv language approach has its
advantages, but here we build a composite list view using a straight Kivy
widget method::

    args_converter = lambda index, rec, key: \
            {'text': key,
             'size_hint_y': None,
             'height': 25,
             'cls_dicts': [{'cls': ListItemButton,
                            'kwargs': {'text': key}},
                           {'cls': ListItemLabel,
                            'kwargs': {'text': "x10={0}".format(rec['x10'])}},
                           {'cls': ListItemButton,
                            'kwargs': {'text': str(rec['x100_text'])}}]}

    item_strings = ["{0}".format(index) for index in range(100)]

    integers_dict = \
        { str(i): {'x10': i * 10,
                   'x100_text': 'x100={0}'.format(i * 100),
                   'is_selected': False} for i in range(100)}

    dict_adapter = DictAdapter(sorted_keys=item_strings,
                               data=integers_dict,
                               args_converter=args_converter,
                               selection_mode='single',
                               allow_empty_selection=False,
                               cls=CompositeListItem)

    list_view = ListView(adapter=dict_adapter)

The args_converter is somewhat complicated, so we should go through the
details. Observe in the :class:`~kivy.adapters.dictadapter.DictAdapter`
instantiation that :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.CompositeListItem` instance is
set as the cls to be instantiated for each list item. The args_converter will
make args dicts for this cls.  In the args_converter, the first three items,
text, size_hint_y, and height, are arguments for CompositeListItem itself.
After that you see a cls_dicts list that contains argument sets for each of the
member widgets for this composite: :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListItemButton`
and :class:`~kivy.uix.listview.ListItemLabel`. This is a similar approach to
using a kv template described above.

The sorted_keys and data arguments for the dict adapter are the same as in the

processing is done.

Uses for Selection
------------------

What can we do with selection? Combining selection with the system of bindings
in Kivy, we can build a wide range of user interface designs.

We could make data items that contain the names of dog breeds, and connect
the selection of dog breed to the display of details in another view, which
would update automatically on selection. This is done via a binding to
selection::

    list_adapter.bind(selection=callback_function)

where callback_function() does whatever is needed for the update. See the
example called list_master_detail.py, and imagine that the list one the left
would be a list of dog breeds, and the detail view on the right would show
details for a selected dog breed.

In another example, we could set the selection_mode of a listview to
'multiple', and load it with a list of answers to a multiple-choice question.
The question could have several correct answers. A color swatch view could be
bound to selection change, as above, so that it turns green as soon as the
correct choices are made, unless the number of touches exeeds a limit, when the
answer session would be terminated. See the examples that feature thumbnail
images to get some ideas, e.g., list_cascade_dict.py.

In a more involved example, we could chain together three listviews, where
selection in the first controls the items shown in the second, and selection in
the second controls the items shown in the third. If allow_empty_selection were
set to False for these listviews, a dynamic system of selection "cascading"
from one list to the next, would result.

There are so many ways that listviews and Kivy bindings functionality can be
used, that we have only scratched the surface here. For on-disk examples, see
these::

    kivy/examples/widgets/lists/list_*.py

Several examples show the "cascading" behavior described above. Others
demonstrate the use of kv templates and composite list views.

    list item and other classes that are to be instantiated by an adapter to be
    used in a listview.  The :class:`~kivy.adapters.listadapter.ListAdapter`
    and :class:`~kivy.adapters.dictadapter.DictAdapter` adapters are
    selection-enabled. select() and deselect() are to be overridden with
    display code to mark items as selected or not, if desired.

    For children, there are two directions for selection, from parent to
    children, and from a child up to parent. The default for
    carry_selection_to_children is True, so selection of children will follow
    that of the parent. This can be handy is the SelectableView is treated as a
    container, without its own cosmetic selection effects, and the UI
    reflection of selection is done by the children (if the SelectableView
    contains a combination of ListItemButtons and Labels for a listview
    row item, the buttons will show selection of the row).

    For the other direction, depending on the layout, the parent (the
    SelectableView) may get events such as on_release. Or, if children
    are ListItemButtons, they might get the events. In the second case, if
    children are to fire selection for the parent, do something like the
    following on the child:

        on_release: self.parent.trigger_action(duration=0)

    Depending on the need, on_release: could be, among other possibilities, an
    on_touch_up: set. SelectableView, the parent, mixes in ButtonBehavior,
    which has the trigger_action() method.

        '''Call the scroll_to(i) method with a valid index for the data. If the
        index is out of bounds, nothing happens.

        If scroll_to() is called with scroll_to(99), then the view instance for
        the 100th data item will appear in the middle of the scrollview.

        We may use the term window-on-the-data to, literally, refer to the
        items currently shown in the scrollview, given the combination of
        row_height and layout controls of the scrollview container size.
        Consider an example where there are 1000 data items, for which the
        scrollview shows 30 view instances at a time. Scrolling will march this
        window-on-the-data along within the data.

        The position and position_as_percent args are available as conveniences
        for placing the view instance for the index at a desired position
        within the range of view instances currently shown, as measured down
        from the default top position.

        If integer values can be used effectively, when the math is understood
        for row_height and container size and so on, the position may be
        specified as an integer, position=x. The x value must not exceed the
        count of the number of items presently shown in the scrollview (the
        math about layout must be understood). For example, a call to
        scroll_to(500, position=5) in the case described, would be the
        equivalent of calling scroll_to(510).

        More often, it is presumed, the position_as_percent will be more
        useful, to ask that the given view_instance be positioned by some
        proportion of the space available for items presently shown in the
        scrollview. For example, if there are 1000 data items, and the call is
        scroll_to(500, position_as_percent=.5, and row_height and the height of
        the container are defined so that a count of 30 items are shown in the
        scrollview, this would be equivalent to calling the default
        scroll_to(500), which puts the view_instance in the middle.  Adjust the
        percentage as desired.

        The optional position argument is measured from the top, so for a value
        of 10, with a count of items in the current view of 30, the specified
        item would appear about 10 rows down from the top.

        The optional position_as_percent argument is measured from the top, so
        a value of .20, with a count of items in the current view of 30, the
        specified item would appear about 6 rows down from the top.

        If a position argument is used, pick one or the other. If both are
        passed, the position_as_percent arg will be ignored.
