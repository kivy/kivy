Stencil View
============

.. versionadded:: 1.0.4

:class:`StencilView` limits the drawing of child widgets to the StencilView's 
bounding box. Any drawing outside the bounding box will be clipped (trashed).

The StencilView uses the stencil graphics instructions under the hood. It
provides an efficient way to clip the drawing area of children.

.. note::

    As with the stencil graphics instructions, you cannot stack more than 8
    stencil-aware widgets.
